## 2025-03-11

Some more fix on vibe data. This patch fixes vibe ending's incorrect render.
Still, this may be incorrect, but the starting point will be correct.

## 2025-03-10

Temporary fix on vibe data. This patch will follow vibe data from CSV using beat values.
Because "enemies" data is also corrupted, some vibe endings will render incorrectly (like only one lights up when there are two notes).
At least the starting point is correct.
