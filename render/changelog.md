# Important Notice

## Optimal vibe point rendering bug

Optimal vibe point rendering has some minor bugs, but starting point will be correct.

# Changelog

## 2025-03-10

Temporary fix on vibe data. This patch will follow vibe data from CSV using beat values.
Because "enemies" data is also corrupted, some vibe endings will render incorrectly (like only one lights up when there are two notes).
At least the starting point is correct.
